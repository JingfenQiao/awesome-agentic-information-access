# awesome-agentic-information-access

We are moving towards a world where there will be millions of such expert LLMs, each trained in different areas of knowledge, some overlapping, some highly specialised. Instead of searching through millions of web pages, users access information by integrating multiple intelligent experts for effective information retrieval and interaction. We would like to dedicate a space to papers and resources on agentic information access.
